            This smart dashboard maps the percent of people of color across Seattle neighborhoods (choropleth). 
            To add context, the dashboard also shows two related neighborhood indicators from ACS: 
            (1) percent of households with limited English, and 
            (2) percent of residents with less than a high school education.

            <br><br>

            Hover over a neighborhood to see all three indicators and compare them in the bar chart. 
            The map colors represent % People of Color, while the chart provides a quick multi-metric profile for the selected area.
            This project is intended to reveal the corelation between racial distribution and educational inequality.
